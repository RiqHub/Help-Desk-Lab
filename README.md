  <h1>Help-Desk-Lab</h1>

Credit to Josh Madakor for helping with the set up of this lab. However I will be taking it a step further by adding a ticketing system to troubleshoot the issues my "users" are having.  This lab will be used to simulate a Help desk environment. 


# The Set-up

![Rename Internet adapters ](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c658cf31-1434-4f68-866e-4b9dd00241a1)

<div align="center"><b>Once I got the Windows server set up in Orical VB with 2 network adapters I renamed them to differentiate between my home internet and the internal internet that the Windows 10 machine would be pulling from.</b>
</div>

![Assigning IP for internat network ](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/89fbd4dd-3460-4543-ae6d-13d606f9749d)

<div align="center"><b>Next, I assigned the internal adapter with a static address. I will use the server as a means to give internet access and IP address to the Windows 10 machine.</b>

![Configuring NAT 2](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8ece7ecd-64ae-47af-8688-b523434e1342)
